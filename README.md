## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- AWS account with SES access (for email functionality)
- AWS CLI installed and configured (for infrastructure deployment)
- A domain name registered in Route 53 (for static website)
- Dependencies listed in requirements.txt and requirements-lambda.txt

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the setup command to create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
./run.sh setup            # For standard application
./run.sh setup-lambda     # For Lambda development (includes all dependencies)
```

## Configuration

The application uses AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for configuration by default.

## AWS Parameter Store Configuration

The application uses AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to securely store configuration values. Set up the following parameters:

- `/ovechkin-tracker/sender_email` - Email address to send notifications from (must be verified in SES)
- `/ovechkin-tracker/recipient_email` - Email address to send notifications to
- `/ovechkin-tracker/aws_region` - AWS region for SES and other AWS services (e.g., us-east-1)

### Setting Up Parameters

Use the AWS CLI to set up the required parameters:

```bash
# Set up sender email (must be verified in SES)
aws ssm put-parameter --name "/ovechkin-tracker/sender_email" --value "your-verified-email@example.com" --type "SecureString" --overwrite

# Set up recipient email
aws ssm put-parameter --name "/ovechkin-tracker/recipient_email" --value "recipient@example.com" --type "SecureString" --overwrite

# Set up AWS region (used by all components of the application)
aws ssm put-parameter --name "/ovechkin-tracker/aws_region" --value "us-east-1" --type "SecureString" --overwrite
```

### Verifying Parameters

Verify that your parameters are correctly set:

```bash
aws ssm get-parameter --name "/ovechkin-tracker/aws_region" --with-decryption
```

> **Note**: The AWS region parameter is used throughout the application to ensure consistency across all AWS service calls. While default fallbacks are in place, it's recommended to set this parameter explicitly.

## Usage

The application provides several commands through the `run.sh` script:

### Display Stats

To display current Ovechkin stats:

```bash
./run.sh stats
```

### Send Email

To send an email with Ovechkin stats to the configured recipient:

```bash
./run.sh email
```

To send to a specific email address:

```bash
./run.sh email-to user@example.com
```

### Test Lambda Function

To test the Lambda function locally:

```bash
./run.sh test-lambda                        # Test with default settings
./run.sh test-lambda --format=flat          # Test with flat format response
./run.sh test-lambda --method=POST --email=user@example.com  # Test email sending
./run.sh test-lambda --config-source=event  # Test with event-based configuration
```

    └── website-updater.yaml # CloudFormation template for Lambda updater
```

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate permissions
- A domain name registered in Route 53 with a hosted zone
- Python 3.11 (for running tests)

### Deploying the Website

To deploy the static website infrastructure, run:

```bash
cd aws-static-website
./run.sh deploy --domain example.com --email your-email@example.com
```

This will:
1. Create an S3 bucket for website content
2. Set up CloudFront distribution with HTTPS
3. Configure Route 53 DNS records
4. Upload initial content

### Deploying the Website Updater

To deploy the Lambda function that automatically updates the website, run:

```bash
cd aws-static-website
./scripts/deploy_updater.sh --schedule 'rate(30 minutes)'
```

This will:
1. Package the Lambda function with dependencies
2. Deploy the CloudFormation stack with the Lambda function and EventBridge rule
3. Configure the Lambda function to update the website on the specified schedule

#### Schedule Expression Options

You can customize the update frequency using various schedule expressions:

- `rate(30 minutes)` - Run every 30 minutes
- `rate(1 hour)` - Run every hour
- `cron(0 * * * ? *)` - Run at the top of every hour (00:00)
- `cron(0,30 * * * ? *)` - Run at the top and half of every hour (00:00, 00:30)

### Updating Website Content

To update the website content manually, run:

```bash
cd aws-static-website
./run.sh update-content
```

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment of the website updater. The workflow is triggered manually via the GitHub Actions UI or automatically on pushes to the repository that modify relevant files.

### Workflow Features

- **On-demand Deployment**: Manually trigger deployments with customizable parameters
- **Automatic Updates**: Automatically deploys when code changes are pushed
- **Configurable Schedule**: Customize the update frequency using schedule expressions
- **Lambda Code Updates**: Option to update only the Lambda function code without redeploying the CloudFormation stack

### AWS OIDC Authentication for GitHub Actions

This project implements OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication between GitHub Actions and AWS, eliminating the need for storing long-lived AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets.

#### Benefits of OIDC Authentication

- **Enhanced Security:** No long-term credentials are stored in GitHub
- **Temporary Credentials:** Uses short-lived tokens to reduce risk
- **Fine-Grained Access:** Precisely control permissions based on repository and branch
- **Auditability:** Monitor usage via AWS CloudTrail

#### Setting Up OIDC Authentication

1. **Deploy the CloudFormation Stack**

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the aws-static-website directory
   cd aws-static-website

   # Make the setup script executable (if needed)
   chmod +x scripts/setup_oidc.sh

   # Run the automated setup
   ./scripts/setup_oidc.sh
   ```

   This script will:
   - Deploy a CloudFormation stack with the IAM OIDC provider and role
   - Configure the necessary IAM permissions for GitHub Actions workflows
   - Set up the trust relationship between AWS and GitHub

2. **Update GitHub Repository Settings**

   After running the setup script, you'll need to add the IAM Role ARN to your GitHub repository:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Variables
   - Add a new repository variable named `AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME` with the value of the IAM Role ARN

3. **Use OIDC in GitHub Actions Workflows**

   Your GitHub Actions workflows can now use OIDC authentication with AWS:

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     deploy:
       permissions:
         id-token: write   # Required for OIDC
         contents: read
       steps:
         - name: Configure AWS credentials
           uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
           with:
             role-to-assume: ${{ vars.AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME }}
             aws-region: us-east-1
   ```

#### Troubleshooting OIDC Authentication

- **Permission Errors**: If you encounter permission errors, check the IAM policy attached to the role
- **Trust Relationship**: Ensure the trust relationship is correctly configured for your GitHub repository
- **CloudFormation Stack**: If you need to update the permissions, you can rerun the setup script

## Optimizing Update Frequency

The website updater can be configured to run on a schedule that aligns with the Washington Capitals' game schedule, rather than running at fixed intervals. This optimization is useful because the NHL API updates anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours after a game ends.
